# **A Guide to Creating an Object With A Skin on Blender :innocent:**
**Unit-2- Creative Computing**

> **Motivation:** 
> 
>I wanted to create this step by step proccess so that people that are new to Blender (the 3D animation and creation software) can understand how to have a 3D object and then apply a skin of their choice (eg. an image they like) to the object. When I was new to the program it was dificult to find all of the solutions online and the program was quite daunting.

> **Software Required:**
> 
> Before you begin ensure that you have Blender 2.93

1. Create an object and place it.
