>I wanted to create this step by step proccess so that people that are new to Blender (the 3D animation and creation software) can understand how to have a 3D object and then apply a skin of their choice (eg. an image they like) to the object. When I was new to the program it was dificult to find all of the solutions online and the program was quite daunting. 

Intructions:
1. Create an object and place it.
